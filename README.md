# BotScripts
A project for Hack the U, a 24 hour hackathon. We created a program that would allow a user to enter code for a bot,
and allowed the computer to generate its own code for a bot that would beat the players bot. The computer uses a genetic
algorithm in order to achieve this goal.

The project was overall a success, with bots being able to learn how to approach the player. However, we did not have
enough time during the event to fully test the bots, or to train them against more advanced bots.
